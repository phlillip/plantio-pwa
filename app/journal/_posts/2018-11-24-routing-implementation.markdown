After reading [Paul Irish's 
post](https://www.paulirish.com/2009/markup-based-unobtrusive-comprehensive-dom-ready-execution/) 
about routing from back in 2009, I have now refactored my code to call only necessary javascript 
for the page in view.

I still need to implement promises in order to ensure processes are running correctly and in the 
right order.
