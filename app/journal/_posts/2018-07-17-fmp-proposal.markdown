        <!-- Exposition | EMPATHY -->
        <p>The Jones family have a two-year-old daughter called Grace. Charlotte and Kevin, Grace’s parents, both work full-time and are conscientious people, with a keen interest in environmental issues as well as human health.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="d--f fd--c half">
      <img src="{{ "/media/storyboard2.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}" />
        <!-- Rising action | FRUSTRATION | Time-->
        <p>Charlotte tried to grow some strawberries during the summer to teach Grace and provide her favourite fruit, however, she did not have time to maintain them and they eventually succumbed to pests in the garden.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="d--f fd--c half">
      <img src="{{ "/media/storyboard3.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}" />
        <!-- Rising action | SADNESS / Seasonal -->
        <p>Grace wants some strawberries. After eating them all summer, it is now October. Strawberries are not in season in the UK.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="d--f fd--c half">
      <img src="{{ "/media/storyboard4.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}" />
        <!-- Rising action | DISAPPOINTMENT / Quality & locality -->
        <p>Kevin picks some Spanish strawberries from the supermarket on his way home from work. After checking the packs, he finds the best of the bunch which are smaller and blander than those they enjoyed in the summer. Kevin takes a keen
          interest in the environment and shudders at the thought of a truck driving food halfway across Europe.</p>

    <div class="d--f fd--c half">
      <img src="{{ "/media/storyboard5.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}" />

      <img src="{{ "/media/storyboard6.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}" />

<section id="justifications">
<div class="content d--f fd--c ai--fs">
<h2>Theoretical Justifications</h2>
<h3>Value Proposition</h3>
<p class="big">Grow food, automatically.</p>
<p>Plant<strong>IO</strong> is the smartest way to grow. One tap and your plant is automatically grown. Our recipes know exactly how to optimise the conditions for perfect growth. All you have to do is wait.</p>

<h3>market size</h3>
<p class="big">£800 Million UK Market Size.</p>
<p>Based on both top-down and bottom-up calculations; briefly, a £200 individual spend level in a demographic 4 million users strong. <a href="#ref" class="reference"> [ 1 ]</a></p>

<h3>market timing</h3>
<p class="big">Autumn 2020 launch into the most affected growing season.</p>
<p>27-month product development plan with the launch during the traditionally weak growing season of Autumn. A staggered launch plan will be implemented allowing for the penetration of additional markets as the product gains traction.<a href="#ref" class="reference"> [ 2 ]</a></p>

<h3>market positioning</h3>
<p class="big">Most advanced, automated consumer system available.</p>
<p>No other company provides a practical home solution that manages all aspects of growing.<a href="#ref" class="reference"> [ 3 ]</a> Aeroponics provides incredible efficiency with optimal control, reducing land usage by 99% and water usage by 98% when compared to traditional farming methods.<a href="#ref" class="reference"> [ 4 ]</a></p>

<h3>company goals</h3>
<p class="big">To improve the availability of quality, organic food worldwide and reduce the environmental impact of growing.</p>
<p>The overarching aim for Ruuts is to make a meaningful contribution to the human race in terms of our environment, sustainability, and the eradication of poverty. Our goal is to have global access to our systems, providing free food in the poorest of neighbourhoods through community growing programs.</p>

<h3>risk profile</h3>
<p class="big">Changing consumer habits is the biggest barrier.</p>
<p>Once users begin to routinely use the Plant<strong>IO</strong> system, the benefits will escalate and adoption of the system will accelerate, enabling us to push into the second stage of our business plan&mdash;the SMB market.</p>

<h3>competencies</h3>
<p class="big">Ruuts have expertise in horticulture, electronics engineering and product design.</p>
<p>We combine the perfect mix of an experienced product designer in myself, with over 15 years of professional design experience, a horticultural expert in Brett Bartlett with a vast knowledge of plant growth characteristics and an aeroponic research program behind him, and electronics engineer Ashley Banner who specializes in designing electronic systems with off-the-shelf components to create bespoke products.</p>

<h3>software technology</h3>
<p class="big">A Progressive Web Application (PWA) is platform independent with instant updates from a single code base.</p>
<p>PWA technology opens up the market to anybody with an Internet connection. JavaScript application communicating with Arduino ran components using Johnny-Five, and Sockets.io real-time communication libraries.</p>

  <div class="content d--f fd--c ai--c list">
  <h2>Shortcomings of Design</h2>

    <h3>Nozzle expensive for single use</h3>
    <p class="big">The design will have to be modular to enable to use of less expensive alternatives such as low-pressure nozzles, bubbling atomizers or even basic D.I.Y. irrigation hoses.</p>

    <h3>Difficult to engage users early on</h3>
    <p class="big">The first harvest requires patience&mdash;some form of distraction may be required to keep the user engaged until they reap the benefits of their first harvest.</p>

    <h3>Initial germination stage needs consideration</h3>
    <p class="big">User interaction is required at this point to ensure a successful harvest&mdash;how can we minimise risk here?</p>

    <h3>Difficult to balance engagement with automation</h3>
    <p class="big">Fully automatic recipes by their very nature have a huge disconnect&mdash;how can we maintain interaction and ownership without creating burden or distraction?</p>

    <h3>Large knowledge base required for recipes</h3>
    <p class="big">Initial recipes can be created by our resident expert Brett, however, development trials will be required to create efficient recipes for all kinds of plants.</p>

    <h3>Difficult to encourage data logging for recipe development</h3>
    <p class="big">In a world of GDPR&mdash;how do we convince the user to provide reporting after a harvest period, including some manual reporting? How can we ensure quality data?</p>

## Appendix
{: #ref .page-break}

1. Based on a bottom-up analysis. Approximately 8 million UK users fit the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_the_United_Kingdom#Age_structure">persona<a />, which equates to 4 million couples, placing one unit per
    family each with a potential unit spend of £200.
2. Approximate timeline of 6 months to MVP in December 2018, a 3-month alpha test, 6 months product development, another 3-month alpha test, 3-months product development, 3-months public beta test, and launch in Autumn 2020.
3. An initial competitor analysis reveals <a href="https://aerofarms.com/frequently-asked-questions/">high-end systems</a> aimed squarely at the business and industrial markets; or <a href="https://eu.clickandgrow.com/products/the-smart-garden-9">low
    end</a>, hobbyist systems utilising low-technology, poorly thought out solutions for the affluent middle class. There is a distinct gap for a highly developed, affordable consumer system.
4. No consumer system exists that utilises aeroponic nozzles, the most advanced system for controlling molecular diameters of liquids. Coupled with the latest wif-fi Arduino Uno board and low energy LEDs shows the concept pushing
  technology in all boundaries.
5. Results obtained from my <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/110GA-5qPCFBt9as8R2DtQPgxbPZQbwrPA91Jolwq-7g/edit#responses"> user study</a> of 54 participants.
6. Mr Kevin Jones underwent a full growing experiment with his family and quoted:

<blockquote><p>We took the opportunity to experience growing our own food as a family. It's been fun introducing the process to our 2-year-old daughter who really enjoyed helping us start to grow our own food and has learnt about how food can be produced and what part nature plays in the process.
<br /><br />
The instructions with the kit we used were a bit vague and missed a few vital elements (such as water occasionally) but with a little bit of improvisation and nature finally taking its course, we managed to start to grow some aubergines,
peppers and green beans.
<br /><br />
It has also encouraged us to grow our own tomatoes which took about 4-5 weeks before we could use them in a homemade lasagne and vegetarian pizza (the Tomatoes tasted noticeably stronger and fresher). It is taking a fair bit of time for the aubergines, peppers and green beans to grow and we will persist but perhaps a simpler solution to assist growing our own food would help make it easier for a family.
<br /><br />
We will certainly try some new methods in the future and are now all excited at the prospects of growing our own food, we are also happy it has caught the interest of our daughter and let us understand more about food as a family as we interact together.</p></blockquote>
