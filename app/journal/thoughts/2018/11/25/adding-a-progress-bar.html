    <p>One of the most pressing pieces of information—aside from the plant’s health—is the
amount of time left until the harvest is ready. After considering a circular design for this, I
decided it would take up too much space and insted went for a horizontal bar in the header, in
place of the defunct “automatic mode” header.</p>

<p>To improve the status of this display I will adding information overlaying the percentage complete,
and time until harvest.</p>
