    <p>After my early confusing tests with <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a>, I was reluctant to
try <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a> however I had early success, managing to sucessfully
deploy that which failed on <a href="https://heroku.com">Heroku</a>. Alas, it was not to be. After discussion
with Al it seems that some of these cloud platforms do not play nicely with socket.io or using
various ports.</p>

<p>Rather than remove socket.io I am going to explore the use of <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital
Ocean</a> and their dropletsâ€”scalable virtual machines run on 
linux with a lot of freedom.</p>
