    <p>So what we’re looking at is how much spray time do we need to be able to penetrate the plant site
and how long does that take to drop off or evaporate.</p>

<p><strong>Light</strong></p>

<p>We can avoid green light as the plants leaves reflect that due to its green colour. We can use red and blue predominantly. From germination through vegetation we can use mainly blue light. Flowering or  fruiting will be mainly red spectrum.</p>

<p><em>But there is also a trick to be played to wake the plants up and help them go to sleep quicker too
I think it’s only blue light in the morning and then red toward the end of the day cycle I’ll have to research that
to make sure I’m right</em></p>

<p><strong>Feed</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Germination</em></strong><br />
Stage: 1<br />
Day: 60 on / 999 off<br />
Night: 30 on / 999 off<br />
Notes: We need to apply maths here for evaporation times of water at different temperatures.</p>

<p>Stage: 2 <br />
Notes: Reduce ON periods according to the growth ratio of the root mass.</p>

<p><strong><em>Vegetation</em></strong><br />
Stage: 1<br />
Day: 10 on / 480 off<br />
Night: 10 on / 999 off<br />
Notes: Roots don’t like to be sat in excess water especially at night when they are not photosynthesizing.</p>

<p>Stage: 2 <br />
Notes: Reduce the OFF period according to the root mass of the plant. We want a balanced even coverage of atomisation to the root mass but not to saturate and damage secondary root hairs.</p>

<p><strong><em>Flowering / Fruiting</em></strong><br />
Stage: 1<br />
Day: 20 on / 240 off<br />
Night: 20 on / 999 off<br />
Notes: (We must consider when flowering or fruiting, often is the case that the environment will be warmer so evaporation rates are faster) adjust off period according to ambient temperature of the root mass chamber.</p>

<p>Stage: 2<br />
Day: 20 on / 120 off<br />
Night: 20 on / 999 off</p>

<p>Stage: 3<br />
Flush cycle: 240 on / 480 off<br />
Notes:  Saturate roots with 0 e.c and 5.8 P.h. Measure the excess water for change in e.c and p.h. Repeat cycle until the e.c and p.h water going in is the same as what is coming out. Flush complete</p>
