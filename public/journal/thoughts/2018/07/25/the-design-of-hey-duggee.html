    <p><strong>Whilst spending a weekend in an Airbnb with four of my closest friends (two couples - each with a small child) I was searching for joy amongst the sleepless nights on a communal settee. Hey Duggee was that joy.</strong></p>

<p><img src="media/hey-duggee.jpg" alt="Hey Duggee" /></p>

<p>I found myself captivated by the show—the simplistic style, the bite-sized episodes, <em>that</em> theme tune and the exquisite animation, the humour of which was only topped by that of the ingenious scripts. Hey Duggee educates children <em>and</em> entertains adults at the same time, a rarity in children’s TV.</p>

<p>Upon my return I began researching the show, confident my vector drawing skills could create a similar style to be used in my app. I found the entire show is created in Adobe Flash, and the creators actually used the limits of the program to define the style. <a href="#ref">[1]</a> When asked about some of the things he learned, the creator commented:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And yeah, just the practical things, really — the pipeline. Accessing files quickly, making sure everyone knows where things are, all of that. Suddenly I appreciate a good pipeline so much. Having a good pipeline is the best thing ever - Grant Orchard</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The show has an episode based around growing food <a href="#ref">[2]</a>, and even has an app focused on the outdoors <a href="#ref">[3]</a> so who knows - with enough success I could even attain a franchise to brand my product farther down the line.</p>

<p>Looking at my medium and restricting it to the technology available, I intend to examine Snap.svg <a href="#ref">[4]</a> as a viable library for enhancing the UI in this area.</p>
