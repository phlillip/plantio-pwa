    <p>Having successfully deployed a working build of my app to a Digital Ocean droplet, I now need to 
set up a production environment which allows the app tyo run as a service in the background.</p>

<p>After looking at <a href="https://github.com/foreverjs/forever">Forever</a> and an enticing solution by 
<a href="https://certsimple.com/blog/deploy-node-on-linux">CertSimple</a> I was pointed to 
<a href="http://pm2.keymetrics.io/">PM2</a> by Al and managed to instantiate a working instance.</p>

<p>However, this was as root user and without the port redirect, so it needs re-implementing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TODO: Set up PM2 for non-root user with custom domina and port handling.</p>
