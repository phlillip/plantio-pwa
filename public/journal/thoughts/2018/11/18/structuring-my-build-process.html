    <p>Writing everything by hand is fine until complexity creeps in, now I need to implement a 
build system such as  <a href="https://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a> or <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">Webpack</a> to take 
some of the repetitive tasks away from me and ensure my app works across browsers and devices.</p>

<p>Having started with Wepback, I came across some build errors at just stage 2 of the official docs - 
<a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/asset-management/">Asset Management</a>. I need to decide quickly how 
long to spend debugging this, or to move onto Gulp.</p>
