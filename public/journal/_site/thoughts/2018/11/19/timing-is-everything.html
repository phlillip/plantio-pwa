    <p>Having refactored my code with GULP (aside from a few js <code class="highlighter-rouge">undefined</code> issues) I now face the 
challenge of promises once againâ€”I need to run concurrent processes for the feed, lights and 
temperature.</p>

<p>I did attempt to refactor the code so a single function powers each element based on passed through 
parameters, however after getting as far as:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>var fn = window[settingsfunctionName];
if(typeof fn === 'function') {
  fn();
}
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>I decided to refocus on the basics and just get it working.</p>

<p>Back onto promises tomorrow.</p>
