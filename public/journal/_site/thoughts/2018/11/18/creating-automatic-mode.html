    <p>Having initially created the prototype with manual mode implemented, it is now important to 
investigate automatic mode and how the user will interact. I have substituted the manual controls 
for a slide up status panel which will provide animated, up to date detailed information about the 
plant. The thermostat is now also in place (albeit styled roughly) and it successfully reads from 
the chosen recipe to reach a target temperature and maintain it.</p>
