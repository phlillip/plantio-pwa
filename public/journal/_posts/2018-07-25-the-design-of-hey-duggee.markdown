**Whilst spending a weekend in an Airbnb with four of my closest friends (two couples - each with a small child) I was searching for joy amongst the sleepless nights on a communal settee. Hey Duggee was that joy.**

I found myself captivated by the show&mdash;the simplistic style, the bite-sized episodes, *that* theme tune and the exquisite animation, the humour of which was only topped by that of the ingenious scripts. Hey Duggee educates children *and* entertains adults at the same time, a rarity in children's TV.

Upon my return I began researching the show, confident my vector drawing skills could create a similar style to be used in my app. I found the entire show is created in Adobe Flash, and the creators actually used the limits of the program to define the style. [[1]](#ref) When asked about some of the things he learned, the creator commented:

> And yeah, just the practical things, really — the pipeline. Accessing files quickly, making sure everyone knows where things are, all of that. Suddenly I appreciate a good pipeline so much. Having a good pipeline is the best thing ever - Grant Orchard

The show has an episode based around growing food [[2]](#ref), and even has an app focused on the outdoors [[3]](#ref) so who knows - with enough success I could even attain a franchise to brand my product farther down the line.

Looking at my medium and restricting it to the technology available, I intend to examine Snap.svg [[4]](#ref) as a viable library for enhancing the UI in this area.
