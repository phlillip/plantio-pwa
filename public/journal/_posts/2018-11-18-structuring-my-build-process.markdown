Writing everything by hand is fine until complexity creeps in, now I need to implement a 
build system such as  [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) or [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to take 
some of the repetitive tasks away from me and ensure my app works across browsers and devices.

Having started with Wepback, I came across some build errors at just stage 2 of the official docs - 
[Asset Management](https://webpack.js.org/guides/asset-management/). I need to decide quickly how 
long to spend debugging this, or to move onto Gulp.
