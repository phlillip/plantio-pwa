Having tried a number of cloud application platforms such as Heroku, OpenShift and DigitalOcean, Google App Engine was surprisingly the most user friendly.

**Quick setup instructions**
```
λ git clone [remote_repository_url]
λ cd into repository
λ npm install
λ npm start (to test click web preview button)
λ gcloud app deploy
```
